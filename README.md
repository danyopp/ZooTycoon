ZooTycoon was a simulation written to experiment with class inheritance in C++. Three animals are kept in a zoo and the player must balance animal costs with zoo revenue. While this could be converted into a game by tightening up the cash flows, my goal in writing it was simply about implementing class inheritance. To that end, don’t expect it to be challenging to make money in this simulation. 

Compiling:
	make – creates game executable titled ZooTycoon
	make clean – delete object files and executable.
